        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>
            The Maze Quest project was born out of a passion for puzzle games and a desire to create a unique maze-solving experience. Inspired by childhood memories of navigating complex mazes in books and games, I wanted to bring that same thrill to the digital world. The journey began as a personal challenge to develop a game that not only provides endless fun but also adapts to the player’s skill level through dynamic maze generation.
